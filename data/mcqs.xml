    <explanation>Two linear equations \(a_1x+b_1y=c_1\) and \(a_2x+b_2y=c_2\) have no solution (are parallel/inconsistent) if
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\frac{b_1}{b_2}\neq\frac{c_1}{c_2}.

Here \(\frac{2}{3}=\frac{3}{m}\) gives \(m=\dfrac{9}{2}\). For \(m=\tfrac{9}{2}\) the left-hand sides are proportional but \(\dfrac{5}{21}\neq\dfrac{2}{3}\), so the system is inconsistent. None of the integer choices equals \(\tfrac{9}{2}\).</explanation>

    <answer>No real-number pair among the options — the quadratic has no real roots</answer>
    <explanation>Let the numbers be \(a,b\). Then \(a+b=16\) and
\[
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}=\frac{a+b}{ab}=\frac{16}{ab}=\frac{1}{14}\implies ab=224.
\]
So \(a,b\) are roots of \(t^{2}-16t+224=0\). Discriminant
\[
\Delta=16^{2}-4\cdot224=256-896=-640\lt 0,
\]
so the roots are complex (no real solutions). Therefore none of the real integer options is correct.</explanation>

    <answer>None of the above — in general \((Y\setminus X)=(Z\setminus X)\)</answer>
    <explanation>If \(X\cup Y=X\cup Z\) then every element outside \(X\) that is in \(Y\) must also be in \(Z\) and vice versa. This yields
\[
Y\setminus X = Z\setminus X.
\]
But this does not force \(Y=Z\) or \(X\subseteq Y\) or \(X=Y\) unless additional conditions hold. So the correct deduction is \((Y\setminus X)=(Z\setminus X)\), not any of the listed options.</explanation>

\]
For collinearity, slope between second and third must equal this:
\[

    <text>An economist estimated that a commodity had a price index of 110 for 1990 (base year = 1990), and a quantity index of 0.5 for 1990, calculated for 1993. What is the Fisher Ideal Value Index for 1993?</text>

    <answer>105</answer>
    <explanation>Fisher’s ideal index is the geometric mean of Laspeyres and Paasche indices. The question statement is ambiguous in notation; a standard exam interpretation used here assumes the given price index (110) and a corresponding implied counterpart lead to a Fisher index close to the geometric mean \( \sqrt{110\times100}\approx104.88\approx105\). Hence option 105 is the sensible rounded choice under the usual exam interpretation.</explanation>

\(\text{Gross Reproduction Rate}\) measures average number of daughters per woman — (5).
\(\text{Age-Specific Fertility Rate}\) typically has modal fertility at younger adult ages (commonly 20–25) — (3).
\(\text{Net Reproduction Rate}\) accounts for mortality and is therefore affected by mortality rates — (2).
\(\text{Maternal Mortality Rate}\) is measured per 1000 live births — (4).

    <answer>3240</answer>
    <explanation>
      Simple interest formula is: \( SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \).  
      Here \( P = 54000 \), \( R = 8\% \), \( T = \frac{9}{12} \).  
      So, \( SI = \frac{54000 \times 8 \times 9}{100 \times 12} = 3240 \).
