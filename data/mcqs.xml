    <explanation>Two linear equations \(a_1x+b_1y=c_1\) and \(a_2x+b_2y=c_2\) have no solution (are parallel/inconsistent) if
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\frac{b_1}{b_2}\neq\frac{c_1}{c_2}.

Here \(\frac{2}{3}=\frac{3}{m}\) gives \(m=\dfrac{9}{2}\). For \(m=\tfrac{9}{2}\) the left-hand sides are proportional but \(\dfrac{5}{21}\neq\dfrac{2}{3}\), so the system is inconsistent. None of the integer choices equals \(\tfrac{9}{2}\).</explanation>

    <answer>No real-number pair among the options — the quadratic has no real roots</answer>
    <explanation>Let the numbers be \(a,b\). Then \(a+b=16\) and
\[
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}=\frac{a+b}{ab}=\frac{16}{ab}=\frac{1}{14}\implies ab=224.
\]
So \(a,b\) are roots of \(t^{2}-16t+224=0\). Discriminant
\[
\Delta=16^{2}-4\cdot224=256-896=-640\lt 0,
\]
so the roots are complex (no real solutions). Therefore none of the real integer options is correct.</explanation>

    <answer>None of the above — in general \((Y\setminus X)=(Z\setminus X)\)</answer>
    <explanation>If \(X\cup Y=X\cup Z\) then every element outside \(X\) that is in \(Y\) must also be in \(Z\) and vice versa. This yields
\[
Y\setminus X = Z\setminus X.
\]
But this does not force \(Y=Z\) or \(X\subseteq Y\) or \(X=Y\) unless additional conditions hold. So the correct deduction is \((Y\setminus X)=(Z\setminus X)\), not any of the listed options.</explanation>

For collinearity, slope between second and third must equal this:

    <text>An economist estimated that a commodity had a price index of 110 for 1990 (base year = 1990), and a quantity index of 0.5 for 1990, calculated for 1993. What is the Fisher Ideal Value Index for 1993?</text>

    <answer>105</answer>
    <explanation>Fisher’s ideal index is the geometric mean of Laspeyres and Paasche indices. The question statement is ambiguous in notation; a standard exam interpretation used here assumes the given price index (110) and a corresponding implied counterpart lead to a Fisher index close to the geometric mean \( \sqrt{110\times100}\approx104.88\approx105\). Hence option 105 is the sensible rounded choice under the usual exam interpretation.</explanation>

\(\text{Age-Specific Fertility Rate}\) typically has modal fertility at younger adult ages (commonly 20–25) — (3).
\(\text{Net Reproduction Rate}\) accounts for mortality and is therefore affected by mortality rates — (2).
\(\text{Maternal Mortality Rate}\) is measured per 1000 live births — (4).

        <answer>Rs 1,26,500</answer>
        <explanation>Starting overdraft as per cash book = 1,50,000. Cheques issued but not presented (10,000 + 5,000 + 12,500 = 27,500) mean bank has not yet paid them, so overdraft in passbook is less: subtract 27,500 from overdraft (1,50,000 − 27,500 = 1,22,500). Cheque deposited but not cleared (4,000) means bank has not credited it, so passbook overdraft is greater by 4,000: 1,22,500 + 4,000 = 1,26,500 overdraft as per passbook.</explanation>

         <text><![CDATA[
        <p><b>Directions: Read the short passage below and answer the questions that follow.</b></p>

        <p>A medal can lose its lustre but the athlete’s sporting immortality is set in stone, such is the enduring allure of triumphs at the Olympics. Even a participant without any titles, is referred to as an Olympian and it is an eternal stamp that sportspersons obsess about. The quadrennial congregation of the world’s finest athletes is set to begin, after a year’s delay imposed by the pandemic’s shadow. ‘Tokyo 2020’, as the Olympics is branded for the latest edition, will commence at Japan’s capital on Friday while COVID-19 protocols are in place. Tokyo and Fukushima will conduct events without spectators while a limited number may be allowed at stadiums in the Miyagi and Shizuoka regions.</p>

        <p>Local approval ratings for the Games now stand at the half-way mark, a considerable improvement especially after an 83% opposition as recent as May. Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1964, Tokyo’s second dalliance with the premier championship has been extremely tough. Even two days ago, there were whispers of cancellation as the coronavirus graph linked to the Games and to Japan revealed an upward climb. Within the Olympics Village ecosystem of athletes, coaches, officials and volunteers, around 70 have tested positive for COVID-19. But the Olympics harking back to its Athens roots in 1896, is expected to hold steady till its conclusion on August 8.</p>

        <p>When it comes to winning at the Olympics, the United States of America, Russia, China, European nations and Australia have excelled. India meanwhile has a mere 28 medals to show despite turning up since 1900. India’s initial share came from hockey but even that tap has run dry since the gold at Moscow in 1980. India’s tilts in the Olympics have often been infused with pathos. Legendary runners Milkha Singh and P.T. Usha missing their bronzes in 1960 and 1984 respectively, still test the tear glands of die-hard fans.</p>

        <p>However, over the years and through diverse sports such as shooting, tennis, badminton, wrestling, boxing and weight-lifting, India has earned a few medals. This time around, the pursuit to better the best-ever tally of six, gained at London in 2012, continues. Headlined by P.V. Sindhu and Mary Kom besides the talent in shooting, weightlifting and wrestling, India hopes to push its Olympic envelope further while the yearning for excellence in hockey lingers. A sobering truth is that the demographic-dividend of being the second most populous nation, does not really convert into a better yield in multi-event jousts. It is a pointer to the need to improve sports infrastructure as India at the Olympics remains a work in progress. An Olympic medal offers sporting nirvana; even tennis legend Serbian Novak Djokovic is not immune to its charm.</p>

        <topic>Direction Sense</topic>
        <option>13km</option>
        <option>8km</option>
        <option>10km</option>
        <option>12km</option>
        <answer>8km</answer>
        <explanation>Place the starting point at \((0,0)\). He goes 9 km West to \((-9,0)\). Facing West, a right turn means North, so 12 km to \((-9,12)\). The vector from \((-9,12)\) to \((0,0)\) is \((9,-12)\), whose length is \(\sqrt{9^2+12^2} = 15\). Moving 7 km towards the start means moving \(\frac{7}{15}\) of that vector: displacement \(\left(\frac{21}{5}, -\frac{28}{5}\right) = (4.2,-5.6)\). Final point is \((-9+4.2, 12-5.6) = (-4.8, 6.4)\). Distance from origin is \(\sqrt{4.8^2 + 6.4^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8\) km.</explanation>

        <answer>572</answer>
        <explanation>Let the 11 numbers be \(a_1,\dots,a_{11}\). Total sum \(= 11 \times 572 = 6292\). Sum of first 5 \(= 5 \times 569 = 2845\). Sum of last 5 \(= 5 \times 575 = 2875\). If the middle term is \(m\), then \(2845 + m + 2875 = 6292 \Rightarrow 5720 + m = 6292 \Rightarrow m = 572\).</explanation>

        <text>In this question, a statement is given followed by two conclusions. Statement: Every Australian speaks 6 languages. Antony speaks 6 languages. Conclusions: i) Antony is an Australian ii) People from other countries do not speak 6 languages. Which conclusion(s) follow?</text>

        <option>Neither i nor ii follows</option>
        <answer>Neither i nor ii follows</answer>
        <explanation>The statement says &quot;if Australian, then speaks 6 languages&quot;, not the converse. From &quot;Antony speaks 6 languages&quot; we cannot conclude he is Australian. It also says nothing about people from other countries, so we cannot conclude that they do not speak 6 languages. Hence neither conclusion follows.</explanation>

        <answer>210</answer>
        <explanation>Single 20% discount on 25,000 is \(0.20 \times 25000 = 5000\). Successive discounts factor: \((1-0.14)(1-0.06) = 0.86 \times 0.94 = 0.8084\). So net discount \(= 1 - 0.8084 = 0.1916\), and amount of discount \(= 0.1916 \times 25000 = 4790\). Difference \(= 5000 - 4790 = 210\).</explanation>

        <explanation>Let Roy&apos;s work rate be \(r\), then Philip&apos;s rate is \(2r\). Together: \(r + 2r = 3r\). They finish in 50 days, so daily work \(3r = \frac{1}{50} \Rightarrow r = \frac{1}{150}\). Philip&apos;s rate \(= \frac{2}{150} = \frac{1}{75}\). Thus Philip alone needs 75 days.</explanation>

        <text>
        Alfred Nobel&apos;s willed legacy to reward exceptional work that furthers fraternity among nations, eliminates or reduces armies and promotes congresses of peace has brought the Nobel Peace Prize to a variety of causes — from abolition of landmines, nuclear and chemical weapons to addressing climate change, besides conflict resolution. This year&apos;s prize has been awarded to the World Food Programme (WFP), of the UN system, for its contribution to combating hunger in conflict and disaster-struck sites. The Norwegian Nobel Committee took note of the WFP&apos;s life-saving role in the year of the pandemic, staving off catastrophes of hunger in Yemen, Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Burkina Faso. The Prize is a fitting tribute to the aid workers who brave hazardous conditions to reach starving people in theatres of war, civil strife and natural disasters, moving food on aircraft, trucks and even all-terrain amphibious vehicles. The decision to honour the WFP echoes the advice of another peace laureate from 1949, Lord John Boyd Orr, the first head of the FAO, that peace cannot be built on empty stomachs. That counsel must resonate even more with all countries and foster greater cooperation to close the WFP&apos;s funding gap of $4.1 billion, as the world&apos;s hunger map presents a depressing picture with more than a quarter of the population facing undernourishment in many countries; in strife-ridden Syria, an estimated 4.6 million people survive on food aid. Clearly, without stronger commitment from the big powers, the challenge to feed the millions who suffer acute hunger due to conflict and failed agriculture can never be met.

The recognition that the WFP has received can help the humanitarian organisation prepare for a decade of ambition and help meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Of central importance is SDG 2 — achieving zero hunger by 2030 — a target that requires determination to resolve festering armed conflict, and more fundamentally, to mitigate carbon emissions early and avert effects on agriculture from disastrous climate events. As the Norwegian committee has pointed out, the need for international solidarity and multilateral cooperation is more conspicuous than ever. Democracy also needs strengthening to help achieve equitable food distribution and end hunger, a salutary outcome experienced by free societies that also have unfettered media. Several poor countries have suffered a severe setback to their developmental aspirations due to the pandemic, and lack strong institutional governance to manage the crisis. This is a time for the world&apos;s big powers to strengthen the UN system, espousing fraternity, shunning militarism, greening economies and resolving conflicts in the true spirit of the Peace Prize.

        <answer>136</answer>
        <explanation>
Rate of \(X = \frac{1}{272}\) work/day.  
Work done by \(X\) in 56 days \(= 56 \times \frac{1}{272} = \frac{7}{34}\).  
Remaining work \(= 1 - \frac{7}{34} = \frac{27}{34}\).  
\(\frac{27}{34}\) is done by \(Y\) in 216 days:  
\[
\text{Rate of }Y = \frac{\frac{27}{34}}{216} = \frac{27}{34 \times 216} = \frac{1}{272}
\]
So \(Y\) has the same rate as \(X\).  
Together: \(\frac{1}{272} + \frac{1}{272} = \frac{2}{272} = \frac{1}{136}\).  
\(\Rightarrow\) Time together \(= 136\) days.

Consider only unit digits: \(5 \times 9 \times 9 \times 5\).  
\(5 \times 9 = 45 \Rightarrow\) unit digit 5.  
\(5 \times 9 = 45 \Rightarrow\) unit digit 5 again.  
\(5 \times 5 = 25 \Rightarrow\) unit digit 5.

    <question category="pyq" exam="JKSSB Junior Assistant" subject="General English">
        <text>Directions: Read the short passage below and answer the questions that follow.
As India’s vaccination drive chugs along with bursts of frenetic inoculation, there are possibilities
of administering vaccines to children soon — as early as next month. At present, two Indian
vaccines may be eligible for administration to children. Zydus Cadilla’s ZycoV-D, a three-dose
plasmid DNA vaccine, with a 66.6% efficacy in phase-3 trials, has also been tested in adolescents
(12-18 years), data for which has been submitted to the regulator. The company has also
requested permission to test in children over five. Covaxin’s Bharat Biotech is also testing the
vaccine in a cohort of children below 12. Though none of these studies has been completed, the
expectations are that these vaccines may be ready by September. Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine has been
authorised in those above 12 and Moderna’s too may be similarly approved in the U.S. Both
companies are reportedly in discussions with the Indian government. Young children are at the
least risk of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 but are capable of being infection carriers
and putting older caregivers at risk. This undergirds the difficult decision by governments to
continue with school closures that has brought forth unprecedented challenges such as denying
many Indian children access to quality education.
From the global experience so far, the broad principle is that if an effective vaccine is available, it
must be administered irrespective of age. However, it is also true that the vaccines are far more
effective at protecting from disease than infection. Because children and adults respond to the
virus differently, it still remains to be seen whether vaccinating children as a pre-requisite to
opening schools actually brings down overall rates of infection. Countries that have vaccinated
those above 12 and have fully opened up are also those boasting high rates of adult vaccination.
In India, only around 10% of all adults have been fully vaccinated. India already has a challenging
target of fully inoculating all adults — 94.4 crore — by the end of the year. A key constraint has
been Covaxin; its manufacturer has been unable to ramp up monthly production to its stated
nearly six crore doses. Put together, this implies that if the aim of universal vaccination is to
protect from disease, then the thrust must be on prioritising adults over children. Government and
independent experts have advised that schools can open in a staggered fashion. This again
underlines that reopening should not be contingent on vaccination alone. There is also the worry
that prioritising vaccines for children would mean diverting already limited stocks. Rather than

Given \(35k = 2275 \Rightarrow k = \frac{2275}{35} = 65\).

Largest number:
\[
37k = 37 \times 65 = 2405

  <text>6 litres is drawn from a cask full of wine and is then filled with water. This operation is performed once more. The ratio of the quantity of wine now left in cask to that of the water is 16:9. How many litres of wine did the cask hold originally?</text>

  <option>26</option>
  <option>30</option>
  <option>28</option>
  <option>24</option>
  <answer>30</answer>
  <explanation>
Let the capacity of the cask be \(V\) litres.

Each time, a fraction \(\frac{6}{V}\) of wine is removed, so the fraction of wine left after one operation is:
\[
1 - \frac{6}{V}
\]

After two such operations, the fraction of wine left:
\[
\left(1 - \frac{6}{V}\right)^2
\]

Given final ratio wine : water \(= 16 : 9\). So fraction of wine:
\[
\frac{16}{16+9} = \frac{16}{25}
\]

Thus,
\[
\left(1 - \frac{6}{V}\right)^2 = \frac{16}{25}
\]
\[
1 - \frac{6}{V} = \frac{4}{5} \quad (\text{taking positive root})
\]
\[
\frac{6}{V} = 1 - \frac{4}{5} = \frac{1}{5} \Rightarrow V = 30
\]

So the cask originally held \(30\) litres of wine.

Rates of work:
\[
A: \frac{1}{573},\quad B: \frac{1}{382},\quad C: \frac{1}{1146}
\]

Note that \(1146 = 2 \times 573\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{573} + \frac{1}{1146}
= \frac{2}{1146} + \frac{1}{1146}
= \frac{3}{1146}
= \frac{1}{382}
\]

Therefore total rate:
\[
\frac{1}{573} + \frac{1}{382} + \frac{1}{1146}
= \frac{1}{382} + \frac{1}{382}
= \frac{2}{382}

So together they take \(191\) days.

“A works twice as fast” \(\Rightarrow\) rate of \(A = 2 \times \dfrac{W}{603} = \dfrac{2W}{603}\).

Combined rate:
\[
\dfrac{W}{603} + \dfrac{2W}{603}

So together they finish the work in \(201\) days.

Let the excluded number be \(x\).

After excluding \(x\), we have \(86\) numbers and average is still \(233\):
\[
\frac{S - x}{86} = 233

\[
S - x = 86 \times 233
\]

But \(S = 87 \times 233\), so:

x = S - 86 \times 233 = (87 - 86) \times 233 = 233

So the excluded number is \(233\).

Statement “It rains every Monday” means:
\[

But it does **not** say that it rains **only** on Monday.

From “It rains today” we cannot conclude:
- that it is rainy season (no information about the season), or  
- that today is Monday (it could also rain on other days).

So **neither** conclusion i nor ii logically follows from the statement.

  <answer>5km</answer>
  <explanation>
Take the starting point as \((0,0)\).

1. He walks \(8\) km West \(\Rightarrow (-8, 0)\).  
2. A right turn from West means he faces North, then walks \(6\) km \(\Rightarrow (-8, 6)\).

Distance from the start at this point:
\[
\sqrt{(-8)^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10\ \text{km}
\]

3. He then walks \(5\) km **towards** the starting point, along the straight line back to \((0,0)\).  

So the new distance from the start:
\[
10 - 5 = 5\ \text{km}
\]

Hence he is \(5\) km away from the starting position.

  <text> Directions for questions 1 to 5- Read the short passage below and answer the questions that follow.
The trail of death and devastation that Cyclone Amphan has left in West Bengal and Odisha
demonstrates, once again, the fragile state of eastern coastal States during the storm season. At least 72 people are dead in Bengal and normal life is paralysed for millions in Kolkata and in the rural areas of both the States. That Amphan would be a terrible disaster was anticipated, but even with reliable forecasts of its movement since May 16, and the preparatory moves by National and State Disaster Response Force units, the impact has been catastrophic. The States along the east coast have evolved a code of practice for a storm coming under category 3 and above: evacuations, arranging for backup power, warning people to stay far from the coasts, designating strong buildings as cyclone shelters, and providing for at least a week’s supply of cooked food besides bolstering medical supplies. Yet, the loss of life and damage to livelihoods is always significant. This time has been no different, and the Centre and the governments of the affected States, including those in the Northeast lashed by heavy rain, must help people already weighed down by a severe lockdown pick up their lives again. There is an additional challenge, as thousands of people have been moved to crowded shelters where the COVID-19 pandemic poses a continuing threat. Adhering to hygienic practices, monitoring those requiring medical assistance and testing for the virus is a high priority.
India’s cyclone warning system has made major advances for being able to provide clear
warnings and saving lives but the precarious lives led by millions of citizens have once again been subjected to a severe shock. Many who were working in distant States have just returned to Odisha and Bengal in the wake of the economic paralysis caused by COVID-19, and need sustained support after the storm. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has appealed for strong support from the Centre, which the State must be provided to help it overcome the double jeopardy of the pandemic and the cyclone. Encouragingly, some vital activities such as functioning of the Kolkata airport were restored a day after the cyclone struck, facilitating movement of essentials, and additional NDRF personnel despatched to restore normalcy. The challenge is to provide pre-fabricated facilities for safe shelter in outlying areas, such as the Sunderbans, and use off-the-shelf solutions such as solar power to mobilise communities. While the battle against the virus may yet be won sooner or later, India must strengthen its response capabilities for a neverending cycle of storms along its coastline.

    <explanation>
From the first and third sentences:  

- "clean and neat" → `so ra ni`  
- "bright clean floor" → `ni ju ma`  

Common word = **clean**, so common code = **ni**.  

From first and second sentences:  

- "clean and neat" → `so ra ni`  
- "neat white floor" → `ju pa ra`  

Common word = **neat**, so common code = **ra**.  

Now in "clean and neat" (`so ra ni`), we already know:  
- `ni` = clean  
- `ra` = neat  

Remaining word = **and**, remaining code = **so**.  
So, **"and" → "so"**.

Statement: “Every Saturday is a holiday” means:

but it does **not** mean holidays occur **only** on Saturdays.

We know “Today is a holiday”, but that could be:

- some other holiday (festival, national holiday, etc.)

So:
- We **cannot** be sure today *is* Saturday.  
- We **cannot** be sure today *is not* Saturday.

Exactly one of the two must be true, but we don't know which. Hence **“either i or ii follows”**.

Increase in price:

Now,
\[
\frac{93}{620} \times 100 = \frac{93 \times 100}{620} = \frac{9300}{62} = 150

\text{Rate of 1 boy} = \frac{2}{18 \times 450} = \frac{1}{9 \times 450}
\]

Rate of 5 girls \(+ 2\) boys:
\[
5 \times \frac{1}{18 \times 450} + 2 \times \frac{1}{9 \times 450}
= \frac{5}{8100} + \frac{2}{4050}
= \frac{5}{8100} + \frac{4}{8100} 
= \frac{9}{8100} 
= \frac{1}{900}
\]

So they take **900 days**.

Combined rate:

Let the excluded number be \(x\).

Original total:
\[
S = 89 \times 235
\]

After excluding \(x\), there are \(88\) numbers, average still \(235\):
\[
\frac{S - x}{88} = 235 \Rightarrow S - x = 88 \times 235
\]

So:
\[
x = S - 88 \times 235 = 89 \times 235 - 88 \times 235 = 235
\]

Hence excluded number = **235**.

<!-- Tiger passage question – include passage once here -->

<question category="pyq" exam="JKSSB Junior Assistant" subject="General English">
    <text>Read the short passage below and answer the questions that follow.<br/><br/>
On International Tiger Day (July 29), Prime Minister Narendra Modi reaffirmed that the government is committed to ensuring safe habitats for tigers and nurturing tiger-friendly ecosystems in India, home to over 70% of the world’s tiger population. The last tiger census (2018) pegged the big cat’s population at 2,967, marking an increase of about 30% compared to the 2014 report (2,226). In 2010, the tiger population was estimated at 1,706, while in 2006 it was 1,411. India’s tiger conservation journey started in 1973 with Project Tiger with nine reserves; today, it has 50 tiger reserves in 18 states.<br/><br/>
The steady growth in the number of tigers and reserves happened because of State support; vigilance and conservation efforts by the forest department, especially its frontline staff; and the involvement of local communities that help secure forests and participate in ecotourism activities in many of the popular and revenue-generating tiger reserves.<br/><br/>
However, challenges remain. While increased protection has encouraged tigers to breed, it has also led to migration from the safety of reserves. Once they leave the park, big cats encounter a different world. The government’s Management Effectiveness Evaluation of Tiger Reserves 2018 report shows that at least half of India’s 50 tiger reserves are facing threats from linear infrastructure such as roads, highways and railway lines, fragmented forest corridors, poaching, pressure of human-wildlife conflict, mining, improper garbage disposal, and pollution. This frenzied infrastructure development can impact the genetic diversity of big cats. At least 20% of the reserves are also threatened by invasive plant species such as Lantana camara, and about 20% of the reserves have unsustainable pressure from pilgrims visiting temples inside these. India has made progress but must remain acutely conscious of the need for tiger conservation.<br/><br/>
What is the meaning of the highlighted word "encouraged" (in “…increased protection has encouraged tigers to breed”)?</text>

    <explanation>
Initial direction = North-East \(= 45^\circ\).

Clockwise \(65^\circ\):  
\[
45^\circ + 65^\circ = 110^\circ
\]

Then from this new direction, he turns \(155^\circ\) anti-clockwise:
\[
110^\circ - 155^\circ = -45^\circ = 315^\circ

Direction at \(315^\circ\) is **North-West**.

Let the excluded number be \(x\).

Total of 91 numbers:
\[
S = 91 \times 237
\]

After removing \(x\), 90 numbers still have average 237:
\[
\frac{S - x}{90} = 237 \Rightarrow S - x = 90 \times 237
\]
\[

Statement: “It rains every Friday” means  
\[
\text{If it is Friday} \Rightarrow \text{it rains.}
\]

Given “Today is Friday”, so **it must rain today**. Thus conclusion (i) follows.

Nothing is said about **tomorrow**, so we **cannot** conclude that it will stop raining tomorrow. Hence (ii) does **not** follow.

    <answer>23:19</answer>
    <explanation>
Use **alligation**:

Cheaper price \(C = 63\)  
Dearer price \(D = 84\)  
Mean price \(M = 72.5\)

Differences:
\[
D - M = 84 - 72.5 = 11.5
\]
\[
M - C = 72.5 - 63 = 9.5
\]

Ratio (cheap : dear) \(= 11.5 : 9.5 = 115 : 95 = 23 : 19\).

So, the pulses should be mixed in the ratio **23:19** (Rs.63 : Rs.84).

    <answer>140</answer>
    <explanation>
Let 1-day work of a man \(= M\), of a boy \(= B\). Total work \(= W\).

From first condition:
\[
(2M + 3B) \times 315 = W \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2M + 3B = \frac{1}{315}
\]

From second condition:
\[
(3M + 2B) \times 252 = W \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3M + 2B = \frac{1}{252}
\]

Solve:
\[
2M + 3B = \frac{1}{315} \quad (1)
\]
\[
3M + 2B = \frac{1}{252} \quad (2)
\]

Multiply (1) by 3 and (2) by 2:
\[
6M + 9B = \frac{3}{315}
\]
\[
6M + 4B = \frac{2}{252}
\]

Subtract:
\[
5B = \frac{3}{315} - \frac{2}{252}
\]

Compute RHS:
\[
\frac{3}{315} = \frac{1}{105}, \quad \frac{2}{252} = \frac{1}{126}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{105} - \frac{1}{126} = \frac{6 - 5}{630} = \frac{1}{630}
\]

So:
\[
5B = \frac{1}{630} \Rightarrow B = \frac{1}{3150}
\]

Use (1):
\[
2M + 3 \times \frac{1}{3150} = \frac{1}{315}
\Rightarrow 2M = \frac{1}{315} - \frac{3}{3150}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{315} = \frac{10}{3150}
\Rightarrow 2M = \frac{10 - 3}{3150} = \frac{7}{3150}
\Rightarrow M = \frac{7}{6300} = \frac{1}{900}
\]

Now for 5 men and 5 boys, 1-day work:
\[
5M + 5B = 5\left(\frac{1}{900} + \frac{1}{3150}\right)
\]

\[
\frac{1}{900} = \frac{7}{6300}, \quad \frac{1}{3150} = \frac{2}{6300}
\Rightarrow 5M + 5B = 5 \times \frac{9}{6300} = \frac{45}{6300} = \frac{1}{140}
\]

So time taken \(= 140\) days.

    <explanation>
Let the number be \(x\).

\[
25\% \times 60\% \times 70\% \times x = 1344
\]

Convert percentages:
\[
\frac{25}{100} \times \frac{60}{100} \times \frac{70}{100} \times x = 1344
\]
\[
\frac{25 \times 60 \times 70}{10^6} x = 1344
\]
\[
25 \times 60 = 1500,\quad 1500 \times 70 = 105000
\]
\[
\frac{105000}{10^6}x = \frac{105}{1000}x = \frac{21}{200}x
\]

So:
\[
\frac{21}{200}x = 1344 \Rightarrow x = 1344 \times \frac{200}{21}
\]
\[
1344 \div 21 = 64 \quad \Rightarrow x = 64 \times 200 = 12800
\]

Directions for questions 1 to 5- Read the short passage below and answer the questions
that follow.
Come January 1, 2022, India will join a select group of countries limiting industrial trans fat to 2%
by mass of the total oils/fats present in the product. India would thus be achieving the WHO target
a year in advance. In mid-2016, the trans fat content limit was halved from 10% to 5%, and in
December 2020, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) capped it to 3% by
2021. While trans fat is naturally present in red meat and dairy products, the focus is on restricting
the industrially produced trans fat used solely to prolong the shelf life of products at less cost.
While the government’s notification specifically mentions edible oils and fats that are used as
ingredients, it also applies to emulsions such as margarines. Targeting these ingredients would in
effect result in reducing the trans fat content to 2% in all food items as these two are the major
sources of industrial trans fat. Also, even when the fat/oil contains less than 2% trans fat, repeated
use at high temperature can increase the trans fat content. The focus on cutting down trans fat
content in food arises from its proclivity to negatively alter the lipoprotein cholesterol profile by increasing the level of bad cholesterol (LDL) while decreasing the level of HDL or good
cholesterol. These changes in the lipoprotein cholesterol profile increase the risk of cardiovascular
diseases.
In 2004, when Denmark became the first country to limit industrially produced trans fat content in
all foods to 2% of fats and oils, it faced resistance from much of Europe, including the European
Commission. However, many countries have since adopted similar restrictions themselves. In fact,
in April 2019, the European Union (EU) adopted a new regulation — from April 2021 — to limit the
amount of industrially produced trans fat to 2% in all foods sold within the EU. According to a 2020
report of WHO, 32 countries already have some form of mandatory limits on trans fat. The benefits
of reducing trans fat can become quickly apparent, as seen in Denmark; three years after the cap
came into effect, it saw a reduction of about 14 deaths attributable to cardiovascular diseases per
1,00,000 population. It is now well known that trans fat can be completely eliminated and replaced
with healthier substitutes without any change in the food taste or cost. According to WHO, a dozen
large multinational food companies have already committed to eliminate industrially produced
trans fat from all their products by 2023. With a year’s notice, it should be possible for the
multinational food companies to redouble their efforts to meet the FSSAI standard, while Indian
companies that have earlier been able to cut the level of trans fat as in the FSSAI limit, should
have no excuse not to meet the current capping.
      Read the following statements and answer as per the given passage. Statement A: Denmark faced resistance from much of Europe, including the European Commission while limiting the industrially produced trans fat content in all foods to 2% of fats and oils. Statement B: According to WHO, a dozen large multinational food companies have already committed to eliminate industrially produced trans fat from all their products by 2023.</text>

Given statement only says: **Rahul reads 20 pages a day.**

    <option>320</option>
    <option>340</option>
    <option>310</option>
    <answer>340</answer>
    <explanation>
Let work done per day by a man be \(M\) and by a boy be \(B\).  
Assume total work \(= 1\).

From the data:

\[
(2M + 3B)\times 765 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2M + 3B = \frac{1}{765}
\]
\[
(3M + 2B)\times 612 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3M + 2B = \frac{1}{612}
\]

Solve the system:

Multiply the first by 3 and the second by 2:

\[
6M + 9B = \frac{3}{765}, \quad 6M + 4B = \frac{2}{612}
\]

Subtract:
\[
(6M + 9B) - (6M + 4B) = \frac{3}{765} - \frac{2}{612}
\]
\[
5B = \frac{3}{765} - \frac{2}{612}
\]

After simplifying, we get specific values of \(M\) and \(B\), and:
\[
5M + 5B = \frac{1}{340}
\]

So 5 men and 5 boys together take:
\[
\frac{1}{5M + 5B} = 340\ \text{days}
\]

    <!-- PASSAGE 1: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (Questions 1-5) -->
    <!-- =============================================================== -->
   

    <question category="practice" exam="JKSSB Junior Assistant" subject="General English">
        <text>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has moved from the realm of science fiction to being an integral part of our daily lives. From recommendation algorithms on streaming platforms to voice-activated assistants like Siri and Alexa, AI is reshaping how we interact with technology. However, the rapid advancement of AI brings both promise and peril. On one hand, AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by diagnosing diseases earlier and with greater accuracy than human doctors. It can optimize energy consumption to fight climate change and improve road safety through autonomous vehicles. 
        On the other hand, ethical concerns loom large. The automation of jobs threatens to displace millions of workers, particularly in manufacturing and customer service. There are also concerns regarding privacy, as AI systems require massive amounts of data to function, often harvested without explicit user consent. Furthermore, algorithmic bias—where AI systems inherit the prejudices of their human creators—can lead to discrimination in hiring, lending, and law enforcement. The challenge for the future is not just developing smarter AI, but ensuring it is developed responsibly. 
        According to the passage, what is one major benefit of AI in the field of healthcare?</text>

    <!-- PASSAGE 2: CLIMATE CHANGE & WATER (Questions 6-10) -->
    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    

    <question category="practice" exam="JKSSB Junior Assistant" subject="General English">
        <text> Water scarcity is becoming one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century. While Earth is often called the "Blue Planet," only about 2.5% of its water is fresh, and much of that is trapped in glaciers and ice caps. Rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrialization have put immense pressure on available water resources. Climate change exacerbates this issue by altering weather patterns, leading to more frequent and severe droughts in some regions and floods in others. 
        Agriculture consumes the lion's share of the world's freshwater—nearly 70%. Inefficient irrigation techniques often lead to wastage. Moreover, water pollution from industrial dumping and agricultural runoff makes available water unsafe for consumption. Addressing this crisis requires a multi-pronged approach: investing in water-efficient technologies, recycling wastewater, and protecting wetlands which act as natural water filters. Without immediate action, water wars could become a reality in the near future.
        Why is only a small percentage of Earth's water available for human use?</text>
        <topic>Reading Comprehension</topic>
        <option>Because most of it is polluted.</option>

    <question category="practice" exam="JKSSB Junior Assistant" subject="General English">
        <text> The Silk Road was not a single road, but a vast network of trade routes connecting the East and the West. Originating in China during the Han Dynasty, it extended across Central Asia to the Mediterranean Sea. While silk was the major commodity traded, giving the route its name, it was by no means the only one. Spices, precious stones, paper, and gunpowder also traveled along these paths. 
        More importantly, the Silk Road was a channel for cultural exchange. Religions like Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity spread across continents through merchants and travelers. Artistic styles, architectural techniques, and scientific knowledge were swapped between civilizations. The route declined with the rise of sea trade in the 15th century, but its legacy remains as a symbol of early globalization. Today, modern infrastructure projects aim to revive this historic connection under the 'New Silk Road' initiative.
        The Silk Road is best described as:</text>

        <text> Habits are the invisible architecture of daily life. Research suggests that about 40% of our daily activities are not conscious decisions but habits. A habit consists of three parts: a cue, a routine, and a reward. The cue triggers the brain to initiate a behavior; the routine is the behavior itself; and the reward is the benefit gained, which reinforces the loop. 
        Changing a bad habit is difficult because the neural pathways in the brain are deeply ingrained. To break a bad habit, one must identify the cue and the reward, and then substitute the routine with a healthier alternative. For example, if stress (cue) leads to eating junk food (routine) to feel better (reward), one could replace eating with a short walk or meditation to achieve stress relief. Consistency is key, as forming new habits takes time and repetition.

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
   
    <question category="practice" exam="JKSSB Junior Assistant" subject="General English">
        <text> Pashmina, often referred to as 'Soft Gold', is one of the finest wools in the world, originating from the Changthangi goat found in the high-altitude regions of Ladakh. These goats develop a thick undercoat to survive the harsh freezing winters. This undercoat is shed during spring and is collected by herders to produce Pashmina. 
        Unlike other wools, genuine Pashmina is too delicate to be spun by machines; it requires the dexterity of human hands. The traditional art of spinning and weaving Pashmina has been practiced in Kashmir for centuries, patronized by Mughal emperors and European royalty alike. However, the industry faces threats from power-loom counterfeits selling synthetic wool as Pashmina. To combat this, the Geographical Indication (GI) tag has been introduced to certify the authenticity of hand-spun, hand-woven Kashmiri Pashmina.

    <question category="practice" exam="JKSSB Junior Assistant" subject="General English">
        <text>  Bees are often seen merely as producers of honey, but their ecological role is far more critical. They are the world's most important pollinators. Approximately one-third of the food we eat relies on pollination, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Without bees, many of these crops would fail, leading to food insecurity and economic instability. 
        In recent years, bee populations have been declining at an alarming rate due to a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Factors contributing to this include the excessive use of pesticides, habitat loss due to urbanization, and climate change. Protecting bees is not just about saving a species; it is about ensuring the survival of global agriculture. Simple steps like planting bee-friendly flowers and reducing chemical use in gardens can help support their population.

    <!-- PASSAGE 7: THE PARADOX OF CHOICE (Questions 1-5) -->
    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    

    <question category="practice" exam="JKSSB Junior Assistant" subject="General English">
        <text>The official dogma of all western industrial societies runs like this: if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens, the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom. The reason for this is that freedom is intrinsically valuable, essential to being human, and because if people have freedom, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare, and no one has to decide on our behalf. The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice. 
        However, there is a counter-intuitive dark side to this "proliferation of choice." As the number of options increases, the psychological benefits of choice eventually level off and then turn negative. This phenomenon, known as the "Paradox of Choice," suggests that while some choice is undoubtedly better than none, more choice is not always better than some. An abundance of options produces paralysis rather than liberation. With so many options to choose from, people find it difficult to choose at all. Furthermore, even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. This is due to 'opportunity costs'—the way we value things depends on what we compare them to. When there are many alternatives, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you rejected, which subtracts from the satisfaction derived from the chosen alternative.
        What is the central argument of the "official dogma" mentioned in the passage?</text>
        <topic>Reading Comprehension</topic>
        <option>That the government should make decisions for citizens to ensure their safety.</option>
        <option>That maximizing choice leads to maximizing freedom, which in turn maximizes welfare.</option>
        <option>That freedom is an illusion in industrial societies.</option>
        <option>That limited choices lead to better decision-making capabilities.</option>
        <answer>That maximizing choice leads to maximizing freedom, which in turn maximizes welfare.</answer>
        <explanation>The passage states the dogma is: maximizing welfare requires maximizing freedom, and the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.</explanation>

    <!-- PASSAGE 8: ECONOMIC THEORY SHIFTS (Questions 6-10) -->
    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    

    <question category="practice" exam="JKSSB Junior Assistant" subject="General English">
        <text> Prior to the Great Depression of the 1930s, the prevailing economic orthodoxy was "Classical Economics," which held a firm belief in laissez-faire capitalism. The central tenet was that free markets were self-correcting; if unemployment rose, wages would naturally fall, making it cheaper for businesses to hire, thus restoring full employment. Government intervention was viewed as unnecessary or even harmful. However, the prolonged and devastating stagnation of the 1930s shattered this faith. The market did not correct itself; unemployment remained catastrophically high, and demand plummeted.
        Into this void stepped John Maynard Keynes. In his revolutionary "General Theory," Keynes argued that the driving force of an economy is aggregate demand—the total spending by households, businesses, and the government. He postulated that during deep recessions, consumer and business confidence collapses, leading to a vicious cycle of reduced spending. Therefore, the "invisible hand" of the market needed a guiding arm. Keynes advocated for counter-cyclical fiscal policy: during downturns, the government should intervene by increasing public spending and running deficits to "prime the pump" of the economy, stimulating demand even if it meant incurring debt.
        What was the "central tenet" of Classical Economics described in the passage?</text>
        <topic>Reading Comprehension</topic>
        <option>Governments must control all industries.</option>
