    <explanation>Two linear equations \(a_1x+b_1y=c_1\) and \(a_2x+b_2y=c_2\) have no solution (are parallel/inconsistent) if
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\frac{b_1}{b_2}\neq\frac{c_1}{c_2}.

Here \(\frac{2}{3}=\frac{3}{m}\) gives \(m=\dfrac{9}{2}\). For \(m=\tfrac{9}{2}\) the left-hand sides are proportional but \(\dfrac{5}{21}\neq\dfrac{2}{3}\), so the system is inconsistent. None of the integer choices equals \(\tfrac{9}{2}\).</explanation>

    <answer>No real-number pair among the options — the quadratic has no real roots</answer>
    <explanation>Let the numbers be \(a,b\). Then \(a+b=16\) and
\[
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}=\frac{a+b}{ab}=\frac{16}{ab}=\frac{1}{14}\implies ab=224.
\]
So \(a,b\) are roots of \(t^{2}-16t+224=0\). Discriminant
\[
\Delta=16^{2}-4\cdot224=256-896=-640\lt 0,
\]
so the roots are complex (no real solutions). Therefore none of the real integer options is correct.</explanation>

    <answer>None of the above — in general \((Y\setminus X)=(Z\setminus X)\)</answer>
    <explanation>If \(X\cup Y=X\cup Z\) then every element outside \(X\) that is in \(Y\) must also be in \(Z\) and vice versa. This yields
\[
Y\setminus X = Z\setminus X.
\]
But this does not force \(Y=Z\) or \(X\subseteq Y\) or \(X=Y\) unless additional conditions hold. So the correct deduction is \((Y\setminus X)=(Z\setminus X)\), not any of the listed options.</explanation>

For collinearity, slope between second and third must equal this:

    <text>An economist estimated that a commodity had a price index of 110 for 1990 (base year = 1990), and a quantity index of 0.5 for 1990, calculated for 1993. What is the Fisher Ideal Value Index for 1993?</text>

    <answer>105</answer>
    <explanation>Fisher’s ideal index is the geometric mean of Laspeyres and Paasche indices. The question statement is ambiguous in notation; a standard exam interpretation used here assumes the given price index (110) and a corresponding implied counterpart lead to a Fisher index close to the geometric mean \( \sqrt{110\times100}\approx104.88\approx105\). Hence option 105 is the sensible rounded choice under the usual exam interpretation.</explanation>

\(\text{Age-Specific Fertility Rate}\) typically has modal fertility at younger adult ages (commonly 20–25) — (3).
\(\text{Net Reproduction Rate}\) accounts for mortality and is therefore affected by mortality rates — (2).
\(\text{Maternal Mortality Rate}\) is measured per 1000 live births — (4).

        <answer>Rs 1,26,500</answer>
        <explanation>Starting overdraft as per cash book = 1,50,000. Cheques issued but not presented (10,000 + 5,000 + 12,500 = 27,500) mean bank has not yet paid them, so overdraft in passbook is less: subtract 27,500 from overdraft (1,50,000 − 27,500 = 1,22,500). Cheque deposited but not cleared (4,000) means bank has not credited it, so passbook overdraft is greater by 4,000: 1,22,500 + 4,000 = 1,26,500 overdraft as per passbook.</explanation>

         <text><![CDATA[
        <p><b>Directions: Read the short passage below and answer the questions that follow.</b></p>

        <p>A medal can lose its lustre but the athlete’s sporting immortality is set in stone, such is the enduring allure of triumphs at the Olympics. Even a participant without any titles, is referred to as an Olympian and it is an eternal stamp that sportspersons obsess about. The quadrennial congregation of the world’s finest athletes is set to begin, after a year’s delay imposed by the pandemic’s shadow. ‘Tokyo 2020’, as the Olympics is branded for the latest edition, will commence at Japan’s capital on Friday while COVID-19 protocols are in place. Tokyo and Fukushima will conduct events without spectators while a limited number may be allowed at stadiums in the Miyagi and Shizuoka regions.</p>

        <p>Local approval ratings for the Games now stand at the half-way mark, a considerable improvement especially after an 83% opposition as recent as May. Having previously hosted the Olympics in 1964, Tokyo’s second dalliance with the premier championship has been extremely tough. Even two days ago, there were whispers of cancellation as the coronavirus graph linked to the Games and to Japan revealed an upward climb. Within the Olympics Village ecosystem of athletes, coaches, officials and volunteers, around 70 have tested positive for COVID-19. But the Olympics harking back to its Athens roots in 1896, is expected to hold steady till its conclusion on August 8.</p>

        <p>When it comes to winning at the Olympics, the United States of America, Russia, China, European nations and Australia have excelled. India meanwhile has a mere 28 medals to show despite turning up since 1900. India’s initial share came from hockey but even that tap has run dry since the gold at Moscow in 1980. India’s tilts in the Olympics have often been infused with pathos. Legendary runners Milkha Singh and P.T. Usha missing their bronzes in 1960 and 1984 respectively, still test the tear glands of die-hard fans.</p>

        <p>However, over the years and through diverse sports such as shooting, tennis, badminton, wrestling, boxing and weight-lifting, India has earned a few medals. This time around, the pursuit to better the best-ever tally of six, gained at London in 2012, continues. Headlined by P.V. Sindhu and Mary Kom besides the talent in shooting, weightlifting and wrestling, India hopes to push its Olympic envelope further while the yearning for excellence in hockey lingers. A sobering truth is that the demographic-dividend of being the second most populous nation, does not really convert into a better yield in multi-event jousts. It is a pointer to the need to improve sports infrastructure as India at the Olympics remains a work in progress. An Olympic medal offers sporting nirvana; even tennis legend Serbian Novak Djokovic is not immune to its charm.</p>

        <topic>Direction Sense</topic>
        <option>13km</option>
        <option>8km</option>
        <option>10km</option>
        <option>12km</option>
        <answer>8km</answer>
        <explanation>Place the starting point at \((0,0)\). He goes 9 km West to \((-9,0)\). Facing West, a right turn means North, so 12 km to \((-9,12)\). The vector from \((-9,12)\) to \((0,0)\) is \((9,-12)\), whose length is \(\sqrt{9^2+12^2} = 15\). Moving 7 km towards the start means moving \(\frac{7}{15}\) of that vector: displacement \(\left(\frac{21}{5}, -\frac{28}{5}\right) = (4.2,-5.6)\). Final point is \((-9+4.2, 12-5.6) = (-4.8, 6.4)\). Distance from origin is \(\sqrt{4.8^2 + 6.4^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8\) km.</explanation>

        <explanation>The statement says &quot;if Australian, then speaks 6 languages&quot;, not the converse. From &quot;Antony speaks 6 languages&quot; we cannot conclude he is Australian. It also says nothing about people from other countries, so we cannot conclude that they do not speak 6 languages. Hence neither conclusion follows.</explanation>

        <explanation>Single 20% discount on 25,000 is \(0.20 \times 25000 = 5000\). Successive discounts factor: \((1-0.14)(1-0.06) = 0.86 \times 0.94 = 0.8084\). So net discount \(= 1 - 0.8084 = 0.1916\), and amount of discount \(= 0.1916 \times 25000 = 4790\). Difference \(= 5000 - 4790 = 210\).</explanation>

        <text>
        Alfred Nobel&apos;s willed legacy to reward exceptional work that furthers fraternity among nations, eliminates or reduces armies and promotes congresses of peace has brought the Nobel Peace Prize to a variety of causes — from abolition of landmines, nuclear and chemical weapons to addressing climate change, besides conflict resolution. This year&apos;s prize has been awarded to the World Food Programme (WFP), of the UN system, for its contribution to combating hunger in conflict and disaster-struck sites. The Norwegian Nobel Committee took note of the WFP&apos;s life-saving role in the year of the pandemic, staving off catastrophes of hunger in Yemen, Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Burkina Faso. The Prize is a fitting tribute to the aid workers who brave hazardous conditions to reach starving people in theatres of war, civil strife and natural disasters, moving food on aircraft, trucks and even all-terrain amphibious vehicles. The decision to honour the WFP echoes the advice of another peace laureate from 1949, Lord John Boyd Orr, the first head of the FAO, that peace cannot be built on empty stomachs. That counsel must resonate even more with all countries and foster greater cooperation to close the WFP&apos;s funding gap of $4.1 billion, as the world&apos;s hunger map presents a depressing picture with more than a quarter of the population facing undernourishment in many countries; in strife-ridden Syria, an estimated 4.6 million people survive on food aid. Clearly, without stronger commitment from the big powers, the challenge to feed the millions who suffer acute hunger due to conflict and failed agriculture can never be met.

The recognition that the WFP has received can help the humanitarian organisation prepare for a decade of ambition and help meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Of central importance is SDG 2 — achieving zero hunger by 2030 — a target that requires determination to resolve festering armed conflict, and more fundamentally, to mitigate carbon emissions early and avert effects on agriculture from disastrous climate events. As the Norwegian committee has pointed out, the need for international solidarity and multilateral cooperation is more conspicuous than ever. Democracy also needs strengthening to help achieve equitable food distribution and end hunger, a salutary outcome experienced by free societies that also have unfettered media. Several poor countries have suffered a severe setback to their developmental aspirations due to the pandemic, and lack strong institutional governance to manage the crisis. This is a time for the world&apos;s big powers to strengthen the UN system, espousing fraternity, shunning militarism, greening economies and resolving conflicts in the true spirit of the Peace Prize.

        <answer>136</answer>
        <explanation>
Rate of \(X = \frac{1}{272}\) work/day.  
Work done by \(X\) in 56 days \(= 56 \times \frac{1}{272} = \frac{7}{34}\).  
Remaining work \(= 1 - \frac{7}{34} = \frac{27}{34}\).  
\(\frac{27}{34}\) is done by \(Y\) in 216 days:  
\[
\text{Rate of }Y = \frac{\frac{27}{34}}{216} = \frac{27}{34 \times 216} = \frac{1}{272}
\]
So \(Y\) has the same rate as \(X\).  
Together: \(\frac{1}{272} + \frac{1}{272} = \frac{2}{272} = \frac{1}{136}\).  
\(\Rightarrow\) Time together \(= 136\) days.

Consider only unit digits: \(5 \times 9 \times 9 \times 5\).  
\(5 \times 9 = 45 \Rightarrow\) unit digit 5.  
\(5 \times 9 = 45 \Rightarrow\) unit digit 5 again.  
\(5 \times 5 = 25 \Rightarrow\) unit digit 5.

\[
92 - 79.5 = 12.5,\quad 79.5 - 69 = 10.5

    <question category="pyq" exam="JKSSB Junior Assistant" subject="General English">
        <text>Directions: Read the short passage below and answer the questions that follow.
As India’s vaccination drive chugs along with bursts of frenetic inoculation, there are possibilities
of administering vaccines to children soon — as early as next month. At present, two Indian
vaccines may be eligible for administration to children. Zydus Cadilla’s ZycoV-D, a three-dose
plasmid DNA vaccine, with a 66.6% efficacy in phase-3 trials, has also been tested in adolescents
(12-18 years), data for which has been submitted to the regulator. The company has also
requested permission to test in children over five. Covaxin’s Bharat Biotech is also testing the
vaccine in a cohort of children below 12. Though none of these studies has been completed, the
expectations are that these vaccines may be ready by September. Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine has been
authorised in those above 12 and Moderna’s too may be similarly approved in the U.S. Both
companies are reportedly in discussions with the Indian government. Young children are at the
least risk of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 but are capable of being infection carriers
and putting older caregivers at risk. This undergirds the difficult decision by governments to
continue with school closures that has brought forth unprecedented challenges such as denying
many Indian children access to quality education.
From the global experience so far, the broad principle is that if an effective vaccine is available, it
must be administered irrespective of age. However, it is also true that the vaccines are far more
effective at protecting from disease than infection. Because children and adults respond to the
virus differently, it still remains to be seen whether vaccinating children as a pre-requisite to
opening schools actually brings down overall rates of infection. Countries that have vaccinated
those above 12 and have fully opened up are also those boasting high rates of adult vaccination.
In India, only around 10% of all adults have been fully vaccinated. India already has a challenging
target of fully inoculating all adults — 94.4 crore — by the end of the year. A key constraint has
been Covaxin; its manufacturer has been unable to ramp up monthly production to its stated
nearly six crore doses. Put together, this implies that if the aim of universal vaccination is to
protect from disease, then the thrust must be on prioritising adults over children. Government and
independent experts have advised that schools can open in a staggered fashion. This again
underlines that reopening should not be contingent on vaccination alone. There is also the worry
that prioritising vaccines for children would mean diverting already limited stocks. Rather than
blindly emulate the West, India must decide on what policy works best for its entire population,
including children.

Given \(35k = 2275 \Rightarrow k = \frac{2275}{35} = 65\).

Largest number:
\[
37k = 37 \times 65 = 2405

  <text>6 litres is drawn from a cask full of wine and is then filled with water. This operation is performed once more. The ratio of the quantity of wine now left in cask to that of the water is 16:9. How many litres of wine did the cask hold originally?</text>

  <option>26</option>
  <option>30</option>
  <option>28</option>
  <option>24</option>
  <answer>30</answer>
  <explanation>
Let the capacity of the cask be \(V\) litres.

Each time, a fraction \(\frac{6}{V}\) of wine is removed, so the fraction of wine left after one operation is:
\[
1 - \frac{6}{V}
\]

After two such operations, the fraction of wine left:
\[
\left(1 - \frac{6}{V}\right)^2
\]

Given final ratio wine : water \(= 16 : 9\). So fraction of wine:
\[
\frac{16}{16+9} = \frac{16}{25}
\]

Thus,
\[
\left(1 - \frac{6}{V}\right)^2 = \frac{16}{25}
\]
\[
1 - \frac{6}{V} = \frac{4}{5} \quad (\text{taking positive root})
\]
\[
\frac{6}{V} = 1 - \frac{4}{5} = \frac{1}{5} \Rightarrow V = 30
\]

So the cask originally held \(30\) litres of wine.

Rates of work:
\[
A: \frac{1}{573},\quad B: \frac{1}{382},\quad C: \frac{1}{1146}
\]

Note that \(1146 = 2 \times 573\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{573} + \frac{1}{1146}
= \frac{2}{1146} + \frac{1}{1146}
= \frac{3}{1146}
= \frac{1}{382}
\]

Therefore total rate:
\[
\frac{1}{573} + \frac{1}{382} + \frac{1}{1146}
= \frac{1}{382} + \frac{1}{382}
= \frac{2}{382}

So together they take \(191\) days.

Let the total work be \(W\).

Time taken by \(B = 603\) days \(\Rightarrow\) rate of \(B = \dfrac{W}{603}\).

“A works twice as fast” \(\Rightarrow\) rate of \(A = 2 \times \dfrac{W}{603} = \dfrac{2W}{603}\).

Combined rate:
\[
\dfrac{W}{603} + \dfrac{2W}{603}
= \dfrac{3W}{603}
= \dfrac{W}{201}

So together they finish the work in \(201\) days.

Let the excluded number be \(x\).

After excluding \(x\), we have \(86\) numbers and average is still \(233\):
\[
\frac{S - x}{86} = 233

\[
S - x = 86 \times 233
\]

But \(S = 87 \times 233\), so:
\[
x = S - 86 \times 233 = (87 - 86) \times 233 = 233

So the excluded number is \(233\).

Statement “It rains every Monday” means:

But it does **not** say that it rains **only** on Monday.

From “It rains today” we cannot conclude:
- that it is rainy season (no information about the season), or

So **neither** conclusion i nor ii logically follows from the statement.
